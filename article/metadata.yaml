abstract: "The input to a neuron can be categorized as driving or contextual.
           There are many ways to write formulations for contextual amplification.
           information theory can be used to study the different forms
           of information transmission. Here the original article on using three-way
           mutual and conditional mutual information to study contextual amplification
           is replicated and the Python code is made public."
